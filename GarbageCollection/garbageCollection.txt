-- in java, Garbage means unreferenced objects
-- Garbage collection is process of reclaiming the runtime unused memory automatically
-- i.e. it is way to destory unused objects

-- Advantages :
-- it makes java memory efficient because Garbage collector removes the unreferenced objects from heap memory
-- It is automatically done by the garbage collector(a part of JVM) so we don't need to make extra efforts

-- How can an object be unreferenced?
-- by nulling the reference :
   Employee e = new Employee();
   e=null;
-- by assigning a reference to another :
   Employee e1 = new Employee();
   Employee e2 = new Employee();
   e1=e2; // now the first object referred by e1 is available for GC
-- anonymous object :
   new Employee();

-- the GC of JVM collects only those objects that are created by new keyword
-- so if you have created objects without new, you can use finalize() method to perform cleanup
-- GC is performed by a daemon thread called Garbage collector. this thread calls the finalize() method before object is garbage collected

-- finalize() :
-- The finalize() method is invoked each time before the object is garbage collected
-- This method can be used to perform cleanup processing

-- gc() :
-- The gc() method is used to invoke the garbage collector to perform cleanup processing
-- The gc() is found in System and Runtime classes
