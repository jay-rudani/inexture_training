-- StringBuffer is a class that provides mutable sequence of characters
-- similar to String class but differs in that it allows you to modify the contents of the string without
   creating new object each time.
-- StringBuffer is the part of java.lang package and is considered as thread-safe, meaning
   it can be safely used in a multithreaded environment without running into sync issues
