-- Strings in java represents sequence of characters
-- it is used to store and manipulate textual data
-- strings are immutable in java
-- string can be created in 3 ways:
-- String str = "Hello"; -> this is called String literal
-- String str = new String("Hello"); -> this called string object
-- String str = new String(arrayOfChars);

-- String pool:
-- its a special memory area where string literals are stored
-- aims to optimize memory usage and improve performance while working with strings
-- ex : str1="hello"; str2="hello";
-- here java only creates one copy of "hello" and stores it in string constant pool
-- which means both str1 and str2 points to the same value in string pool
-- this concept is also referred as "string interning" which involves
   adding strings to pool if it doesn't exists, and returning a reference to the existing string if it does

-- Immutable :
-- for Thread safety, security, hashing, caching and performance, pool and memory optimization, predictable behavior
   , method params and return values etc.
