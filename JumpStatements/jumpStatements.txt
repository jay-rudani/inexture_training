-- Jump statements in java are used to control the flow of program execution by transferring control
   to different parts of the code

-- break statement :
-- it is used to exit a loop or a switch statement permaturely
-- when it is encountered within a loop/switch statement, the program flow immediately exits the loop/switch
-- used to terminate loop early based on a certain condition

-- continue statement :
-- used to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration
-- when it is encountered, the remaining code in the loop for the current iteration is skipped
-- then loop proceeds with the next iteration

-- return statement :
-- return is used to exit a method and return a value to the caller

-- labeled break :
-- labeled break is used to exit from nested loops or switch statements
-- it allows you to specify which loop/switch you want to break out of when dealing with multiple levels of nested constructs
-- syntax :
-- labelName : break;
