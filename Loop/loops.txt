-- Loop allow you to execute a block of code repeatedly

-- for loop :
-- use 'for' loop when you know the no. of iterations beforehand or
-- when you need to iterate over a range of values a specific no. of times
-- for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
--      // code
-- };

-- while loop :
-- use when you want to repeatedly execute block of code as long as a certain condition is true
-- useful when exact no. of iterations is unknown or can vary
-- ensure that the loop condition can become false, otherwise you might end up in an infinite loop
-- while(condition) {
--      // code
-- }

-- do-while loop :
-- use when you want to ensure that the loop body body is executed at least once, regardless of whether 
   the condition is initially true or false
-- do {
--    // code
-- } while(condition);

-- for-each loop :
-- useful when want to iterate over all the elements in a DS without worrying about the index
   or explicit bounds checking
-- this for loop is only available for iterating over arrays and objects who implements Iterable interface
