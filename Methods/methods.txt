-- Methods in Java are blocks of code that perform certain task or action

-- Static Methods :
-- these are also known as class methods, and associated with class only rather than with instances of class
-- they are declared using 'static' keyword
-- it can be called directly without creating instances
-- they can only directly access static members of the class
-- they can't use instance variables or call non-static methods without creating an instance of the class
-- they are commonly used for utility functions, helper methods etc.

-- Non-static Methods :
-- these are associated with instances of class so an instance should be created before using them
-- they are declared without 'static' keyword
-- they can access both static (using class name) and instance members of the class

-- Method Chaining :
-- it is a technique that allows you to call multiple methods on the same object in a single line of code
-- this can lead to more concise and readable code
-- ex : object.setFirstname("JAY").setLastname("RUDANI");
