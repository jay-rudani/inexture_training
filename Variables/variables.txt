-- Local Variables :
-- these are declared within a method, constructor or block
-- And are only accessible within that specific scope
-- they must be initialized before used

-- Instance Variables :
-- these are declared within the class but outside any method or block
-- each instance of the class has its own copy for instance variables
-- if they are not initialized then default value will be taken

-- Static Variables :
-- these are declared with 'static' modifier within a class
-- they belong to class, not to objects
-- these are shared among all the objects
