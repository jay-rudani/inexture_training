-- It is a part of java.util package
-- It represents a collection of elements where each element is unique, meaning that no two elements can be equal with the same Set
-- It does not allow duplicates and does not guarantee any specific order of elements
-- It does not allow null elements except HashSet which allows only one null element

-- HashSet :
-- this implementation uses a hash table to store elements
-- it offers constant-time average complexity for basic ops like add, remove, contains
-- does not guarantee specific order of elements

-- LinkedHashSet :
-- it maintains a doubly-linkedlist in addition to hash table, which allows it to maintain the order of insertion

-- TreeSet :
-- elements in a TreeSet are stored in a sorted order
-- it uses red-black tree to maintain this order
-- elements must be comparable or provided with a custom 'Comparator'
