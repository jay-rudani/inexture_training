-- List is an interface that extends collection interface
-- A list is used to store ordered collection of data and it may contain duplicates
-- the elements present, can be accessed or inserted by their position in the list using zero-based indexing
-- the list implemented by LinkedList, ArrayList, Vectors and Stack classes

-- ArrayList :
-- it is similar to arrays
-- they are also called dynamic arrays means it does not have fixed size
-- its size can be increased or decreased if elements are added or removed

-- LinkedList :
-- it extends AbstractSequentialList and also extends the List, Deque, Queue interface
-- it is a linear data structure where the elements are called as nodes
-- each node has 2 fields, data and next
-- elements are not stored in contiguous memory, so direct access to that element is not possible
-- LinkedList uses DoublyLinkedList to store its elements while ArrayList internally uses a dynamic array
   to store its elements
-- LinkedList is faster in the manipulation of the data
