-- Abstract class allows you to create both concrete and abstract methods
-- Abstract classes cannot be instantiated on their own but serve as a blueprint for other classes to inherit from

-- Properties :
-- abstract class contains abstract methods (without body) that should be overridden by a class who extending it
-- also contains concrete methods as well with method body
-- they can have instance variables just like regular classes
-- these variables can hold data that is common to all subclasses
-- abstract classes can have constructors used to initialize the state of objects when they are created,
   subclasses typically call this constructors using super keyword
-- Abstract classes facilitate polymorphism, allowing you to treat objects of different subclasses as instances of the abstract class
   This can be useful for creating more generalized code
