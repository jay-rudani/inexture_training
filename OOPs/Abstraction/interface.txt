-- Java interface defines a contract set of methods that a class must implement
-- It allows you to establish a common interface that multiple classes can adhere to,
   promoting a consistent behavior across different implementations.

-- Properties :
-- an interface can only have method declarations, no method body
-- multiple inheritance is achieved using interface
-- provides abstraction
-- from Java 8, interface can have default and static methods
-- default methods provide a default implementation that implementing classes can use or override
-- static methods are only associated with interface itself, not the implementing classes

-- Limitations :
-- no constructor
-- no instance variables
-- no method bodies
-- less code-reusability etc
