-- Constructors in java are special methods used to initialize objects when they are created
-- it plays a crucial role in initializing the instance variables of a class and preparing an object for use

-- Types :
-- Default Constructor :
-- if a class does not have any explicitly defined constructors, Java automatically provides a default
   constructor with no params. This constructor initializes instance variables with default values.

-- Parameterized Constructor :
-- these constructors accept params when objects are created
   they allow you to initialize instance variables with specific values provided during object creation

-- Copy Constructor :
-- A copy constructor creates a new object by copying the values from another object of the same class

-- Chained Constructor :
-- constructor can call another constructors of the same class using 'this' keyword

-- Private Constructor :
-- these are used to prevent the class instantiation from outside the class itself
-- this serves as a utility class and should not be instantiated
