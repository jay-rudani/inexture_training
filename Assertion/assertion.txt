-- An assertion allows testing the correctness of any assumptions that have been made in the program
-- it is achieved using the assert statement in java
-- while executing assertion, it is believed to be true, if it fails, JVM throws an error named AssertionError
-- it is mainly used for testing purposes

-- The assert statement is used with boolean expression can be written in 2 different ways :
-- First way :
   assert : expression;
-- Second way :
   assert expression1 : expression2;

-- To enable assertion :
   java -ea TestClass
-- To disable assertion :
   java -da TestClass

-- Why to use :
-- whenever a programmer wants to see if their assumptions are wrong or not
-- to make sure that an unreachable-code is actually unreachable
-- to make sure that assumptions written in comments are right
-- to make sure that the default switch case is not reached
-- to check object's state

-- Where to use :
-- arguments to private methods.
   Private arguments are provided by the developerâ€™s code only and the developer may want to check his/her assumptions about arguments
-- Conditional cases
-- Conditions at the begining of the any method
