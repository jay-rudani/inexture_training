-- Array in java is a data structure that is used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable
-- each array element is accessed by its index starts from 0

-- syntax
-- dataType[] arrayName = new dataType[size];
-- ex : int[] numbers = new int[5];
-- initialize with values : int[] numbers = {1,2,3,4,5};
-- access : int firstNum = numbers[0];
-- length : int arrayLength = array.length;

-- multidimensional array :
-- Java also supports multi-dimensional arrays, which are arrays of arrays

-- jagged array :
-- it is an array whose elements are also arrays
-- however, unlike regular multidimensional array where all the subarrays have the same length,
-- in a jagged array, the subarrays can have different lengths
-- this allows you to create a matrix where each row can have different no. of elements
