-- Java tokens are smallest individual units in the source code
-- They form the build blocks for java programs
-- Tokens includes keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, separators and comments

-- Keywords :
-- these are reserved words in Java & cannot be used as identifiers
-- ex : class, public, static, if, while, return, void etc.

-- Identifiers :
-- these are names that are given to variables, methods, classes and other elements
-- rules for an identifier : must start with a letter (uppercase/lowecase), underscore (_) or dollarSign ($)
-- Java is case-sensitive : myVar and MyVar both are different

-- Literals :
-- these are constant values that appear in the code
-- ex : Integer literal -> 123, Floating-point literal -> 1.3, String literal -> "Jay" etc.

-- Operators :
-- these are used to perform operations on variables and values
-- it can be unary, binary, arithmetic etc.
-- ex : +, -, *, /, %, ?: etc.

-- Separators :
-- these are characters used to separate parts of the code
-- ex : ',', ';', '{', '}', '[', ']', '(', ')', '.' etc

-- Comments :
-- these are not processed by compiler, just for the documentation or explanation
-- // Single-line comment
-- /*...*/ Multi-line comment
