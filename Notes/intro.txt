-- history:
-- created by James gosling 1995 at Sun microsystems
-- now owned by Oracle, more than 3B devices run Java
-- it is platform independent which means you can run java bytecode (.class file) on any platform
-- used for mobile apps, desktop apps, web apps, servers, games, databases connections etc.

-- Why Java:
-- works on different platforms
-- simple and open source
-- secure, fast and powerful
-- its an OOP language for clear programming structure and better code reusability etc.

-- JDK, JRE and JVM:
-- JDK : its development kit holds development tools (javac, java) for developing Java apps that also contains JRE and JVM
-- JRE : its a runtime environment that holds set of libraries (jars etc) and provides environment for JVM
         NOTE : JRE is must to have in the system to run any java program or app
                JVM is the part of JRE
-- JVM : its virtual machine that converts bytecode into machine code and it loads code, verifies code, executes code

-- to compile Java program using command:
-- $ javac name_of_file.java
-- to run Java program using command:
-- $ java name_of_class
