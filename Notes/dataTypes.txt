-- There are 3 types of Data in Java
-- Primitive, Reference and User-defined

-- Primitive :
-- these are simply used to represent values
-- they are not objects and stored directly in memory
-- 1. byte : 8-bit signed integer, range -128 to 127
-- 2. short : 16-bit signed integer, range -32768 to 32767
-- 3. int : 32-bit signed integer, range -2^31 to 2^31-1
-- 4. long : 64-bit signed integer, range -2^63 to 2^63-1
-- 5. float : 32-bit floating-point number
-- 6. double : 64-bit floating-point number
-- 7. char : 16-bit unicode character
-- 8. boolean : true or false

-- Reference :
-- these are used to store references to objects rather than the actual data.
-- these includes classes, arrays, interfaces etc.

-- User-defined :
-- you can also create your own user-defined data types using classes and interfaces
-- These custom data types allow you to model real-world entities with specific attributes and behaviors
