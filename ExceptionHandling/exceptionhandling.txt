-- Exception handling in Java is a powerful mechanism to handle runtime exception to prevent abnormal termination
   of the program
-- errors are different from exception, an error is irrecoverable

-- Throwable is the root class of exceptions and errors
-- exceptions -> IOException, SQLException, ClassNotFoundException, RuntimeException
   RuntimeException -> ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, NumberFormatException, IndexOutOfBoundsException
                       IndexOutOfBoundsException -> ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, StringIndexOutOfBoundsException
-- errors -> StackOverflowError, VirtualMachineError, OutOfMemoryError

-- there are two types of exceptions :

-- Checked Exception (compile-time) :
-- these are exceptions that the java requires you to handle it explicitly
-- this means a method throws a Checked exception, you must either catch it using try-catch block
   or declare that your method may throw this exception using throws keyword in its method signature.
-- the classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions
-- ex : IOException, SQLException etc.

-- Unchecked Exception (run-time) :
-- The classes that inherit the RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions
-- For example, ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException, etc
-- Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time, but they are checked at runtime

-- try block :
-- in which we should write a code that might cause an exception
-- it can't be used alone, it must be followed either by catch or by finally

-- catch block :
-- it is used to handle exception
-- it must be preceeded by try block

-- finally block :
-- it is used to execute necessary code of the program
-- this block will be executed whether an exception is occurred/handled or not

-- throw keyword used to throw an exception
-- throws keyword is used to declare exceptions, that there may occur an exception in the method
   it does not throw an exception, always used with method signature.

-- in multi-catch block, exception should be defined from most specific to general
